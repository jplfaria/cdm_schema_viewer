# CDM Schema Viewer Fixes Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Filter Out Abstract Base Classes
- **File**: `src/services/schemaParser.ts`
- **Changes**: 
  - Added a set of abstract base classes to exclude: `Table`, `Any`, `AttributeValue`, `NamedEntity`, `IdentifiedEntity`, `AttributeValueEntity`
  - These classes are now filtered out during node creation
  - Inheritance edges to abstract classes are also excluded

### 2. Improved Layout Algorithm
- **File**: `src/hooks/useLayoutEngine.ts`
- **Changes**:
  - Added a new `applyGridLayout` function that arranges entities in a grid pattern
  - Grid layout groups entities by domain for better organization
  - Adjusted spacing parameters for better visual clarity
  - Grid dimensions are calculated dynamically based on node count

- **File**: `src/components/Canvas/SchemaCanvas.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Updated to use grid layout as the default for overview mode
  - Different layout algorithms are applied based on view mode:
    - Overview: Grid layout
    - Domain: Domain-grouped layout
    - Detailed/Compact: Hierarchical layout

### 3. Dynamic Export Viewport
- **File**: `src/components/Canvas/CanvasControls.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Added `calculateImageDimensions` function to dynamically size exports based on content
  - Minimum dimensions of 1920x1080, but expands as needed to fit all content
  - Adjusted zoom and padding parameters for better capture
  - Both PNG and SVG exports now use dynamic dimensions

### 4. Junction Table Handling (Foundation)
- **File**: `src/services/schemaParser.ts`
- **Changes**:
  - Added support for `hideJunctionTables` option in `parseSchemaToGraph`
  - Detects pure junction tables (those with only foreign keys)
  - When hidden, junction tables are converted to direct many-to-many relationships
  - Junction table names are preserved as edge labels

## Results

These fixes address all the reported issues:

1. ✅ Abstract base classes are no longer displayed as standalone entities
2. ✅ Entities are arranged in a grid layout instead of a single horizontal row
3. ✅ Export functions dynamically calculate viewport to capture entire diagram
4. ✅ Foundation for hiding junction tables is implemented (can be enabled via options)

## Testing

Run the development server to test the changes:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Build for production:
```bash
npm run build
```

The viewer should now:
- Display only concrete entity classes
- Arrange entities in a more readable grid layout
- Export complete diagrams without cutoff
- Have cleaner relationship visualization
